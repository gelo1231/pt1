        The United Nations (UN) is an international organization founded on October 24, 1945, after the conclusion of World War II.

        The UN is structured with various bodies, including the General Assembly, the Security Council, the International Court of Justice, the Secretariat, and specialized agencies, each with specific functions and responsibilities. Its member states, currently numbering 193, come together to discuss and address global challenges with the goal of creating a more peaceful and just world.
